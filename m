But that breaks "make dtbs_check", doesn't it?

I would think that the DT bits - bindings first, then DTS files using it -
should be bundled. This is how I imagine the future(TM), where DTs and
bindings live outside the kernel repo.

I understand that the bindings describe the contract the driver acts on,
but going forward I think driver changes would need to come later, then
(since they will live in a separate repo at some day)?
Maybe pointing to the binding changes in progress?

So with a separate repo we would actually need to upstream just the
bindings first, then could push driver changes and .dts files
independently?

And for now it looks like we are stuck with putting everything in one
series, to make both checkpatch and dtbs_check happy.

Cheers,
Andre
