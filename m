Thats not what I'm asking. I would like to see *optional* nodes
disabled by default. Whether the watchdog is optional might be
debatable, but what about the usb controller and the qspi
controller? They don't have shared pins AFAIK, so according
to your rule, they will be enabled by default and each board
which doesn't have anything connected on these pins would have
to disabled it.

Please keep in mind that this .dtsi will also be used by boards
not manufactured by microchip.
