First, there is distinction between SoC having and not having modem. I
guess small enough that we just include the DTSI.

Second, there is distinction between different families, even if they
share a lot. All of the SoCs here share something, because Qualcomm has
versionable IP blocks which they re-use.

It's not only about board, but about all devices in the SoC.

You don't have to create such relationships. You don't have to include
other DTSI, either. What yo have to is - quoting Linux docs:
"DO make 'compatible' properties specific. DON'T use wildcards in
compatible strings. DO use fallback compatibles when devices are the
same as or a subset of prior implementations. DO add new compatibles in
case there are new features or bugs."

We do not talk here about apq, actually, at all. We talk about one
msm8xxx including other msm8xxx...
