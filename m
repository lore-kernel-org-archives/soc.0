None? What I know is that

 - Toradex is building SoM since 20 years and not planning to stop any
   time soon
 - Recently we decided to get into the SMARC market
 - From an engineering side we decided that it was the best decision to
   have a small microcontroller to act as an embedded controller, sitting
   between the SoC and the PMIC, handling reset, power-up/down sequence,
   strapping options, I/Os and potentially more
 - In our roadmap we have more SMARC based products planned
 - The firmware interface is designed to be generic and handle future
   boards
 - We expect to use the same driver for any upcoming board using such
   embedded controller, the EC firmware and the DT will be the only
   differences.

But, I do not have a third product in my hands now, so, I have no such a
thing as 99% guarantee. Honestly I have only one thing in my future with
such a high probability ;-)

Can you be more specific here? You mean the `toradex` directory, within
`drivers/platform`? The only reason is that maybe we'll break the driver
in multiple files, but we can as well just get rid of it. We did not
think much at it.

BTW, the idea to have this driver in such a way was partially inspired
by drivers/platform/cznic/, that was merged a few months ago.
