Nicely summarised or categorised Jonathan. Nothing much to add.

For most of the IP/devices/firmware associated with Arm, we are involved
in any specification work if there are any. However that doesn't include
3rd party IPs/devices used on Arm based platforms though.

Ideally, it should be just HID that any vendor needs to publish unless
they make use of any custom methods or something device specific like
DSD/DSM. I would expect most of the devices to use standard methods and
properties that are already well defined in the ACPI spec.

Agreed, it shouldn't hurt to cc linux-acpi for such driver ACPI enablement
patches.
