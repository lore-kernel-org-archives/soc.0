  remoteproc/wkup_m3: Use reset control driver if available (2020-11-16 12:57:40 +0200)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Driver changes for omaps for genpd for v5.11 merge window

This series of changes allows booting am335x with genpd and
device tree data without the legacy platform data. Also at
least am437x can be booted with gendp with power domain and
dts data. The SoC specific dts changes will be a separate
pull request.

We need the following driver changes merged before the dts
changes can be done:

- platform code needs a few improvments to probe l4_wkup first
  for clocks, and to bail out when there is no platform data

- ti-sysc driver needs a non-urgent fix for asserting rstctrl
  reset only after disabling the clocks, to probe modules with
  no known control registers, and added quirk handling for gpmc
  devices

- omap-prm driver needs a non-urgent fix for reset status bit,
  support added for pm_clk, and then we add the rest of am335x
  power domain data

- clock driver for am335x needs to keep l3_main clock enabled
  with genpd for suspend and resume to work

- wkup_m3 remoteproc driver needs support added for reset
  control if available instead of the legacy pdata callbacks

- pm33xx driver needs PM runtime support added for genpd

The am335x specific driver changes for the clock, wkup_m3,
pm33xx and remoteproc drivers are quite trivial and have not
caused merge conflicts in Linux next. I did not get acks for
these changes except from Santosh but had already pushed out
the branch already at that point. So I've added the related
driver maintainers to Cc.
