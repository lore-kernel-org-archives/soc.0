It is in whatever was there when I fetched the trees this morning which
was some time before I finished the merge and ran the summary stuff so
you may have updated it later.

As indicated in the original mail and repeated followups the relevant
commit is 3edcea7f0413e84863300998ad3838eb87e6fca7 which looks from the
changelog like it was originally a merge but is not described as such in
the git metadata, it is just an apparently empty commit with a single
parent with a suspiciously similar changelog.  My theory was that
something had gone wrong with a rebase or scripting.  I only check for
signoff problems on non-merge commits, merge commits are ignored since
they are not normally signed off.
