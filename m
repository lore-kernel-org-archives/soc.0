We want to use the 'device-flags' to report some information by bit.
Currently, this driver requests PCC channel and use type2 to communicate 
with firmware.
But, if some platform support type3 and PCC Operation Region, driver can 
choice this method to communicate with firmware.
So firmware and driver have to use this flag to make compatibility.

Yes，driver can get pcc-chan-id by below register.

Register (PCC, RegisterBitWidth, RegisterBitOffset, RegisterAddress, AccessSize)

Yes, PCC driver doesn't support it currently. And aother patch [1] we've 
been talking about does it.
If it is applied to kernel, we can drop this pcc-type here.

My confusion about this address is mentioned below.

List all the registers as following way?
Name (_CRS, ResourceTemplate ()  // _CRS: Current Resource Settings
{
     QWordMemory (ResourceProducer, PosDecode, MinFixed, MaxFixed, 
NonCacheable, ReadWrite,
         0x0000000000000000, // Granularity
         0x0000000098190000, // Range Minimum
         0x000000009819FFFF, // Range Maximum
         0x0000000000000000, // Translation Offset
         0x0000000000010000, // Length
         ,, , AddressRangeMemory, TypeStatic)
})

Following words come from ACPI spec.
-->
As an example, the following resource template refers to the feld 
occupying bits 8 through 15 at address 0x30 in PCC
subspace 9:
ResourceTemplate()
{
Register (
     PCC, //AddressSpaceKeyword
     8, //RegisterBitWidth
     8, //RegisterBitOffset
     0x30, //RegisterAddress
     9 //AccessSize (subspace ID)
     )
}

If the width of the address is 32bit, set RegisterAddress to 0, 
RegisterBitOffset to 0 and set RegisterBitWidth to 64 here.
Driver can access to the ((void __iomem *)pcc_comm_addr + 0x8 + 0) and 
((void __iomem *)pcc_comm_addr + 0x8 + 4) address，right?
(This virtual address = pcc mapped address + header size + offset within 
PCC subspace.)

Sorry, here is what I want to say.
-->
OperationRegion (CCS0, SystemMemory, 0x00000002081000CC, 0x04)
Field (CCS0, DWordAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
{
     HAU1,   32
}
OperationRegion (CCS1, SystemMemory, 0x0000000201070410, 0x04)
Field (CCS1, DWordAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
{
     HCGE,   32
}
Method (_DSM, 2, Serialized)  // _DSM: Device-Specific Method
{
     If ((Arg0 == ToUUID ("b06b81ab-0134-4a45-9b0c-483447b95fa7")))
     {
         If ((Arg1 == One))
         {
             Return (HAU1)
         }

         Return (HCGE)
     }
}

Driver can call _DSM method to get some information, such as pcc_chan_id 
and device_flags.
