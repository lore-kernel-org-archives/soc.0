I was not aware of that rule.

It is a bit of a mixed situation with Broadcom SoCs but in essence, each 
Kconfig entry denotes a deeply different SoC architecture at the memory 
subsystem, bus, security or product space that you might not want to 
enable in your kernel. There is definitively sharing of drivers between 
all of the platforms and a lot of cross pollination too but usually 
these are deeply different that different kernel images do make sense.

The itch that I wanted to calm was that ARCH_BRCMSTB was after the other 
Broadcom platforms separated by ARCH_BERLIN. if you prefer a pair of 
KConfig comments to delineate them and flatten the platform selection, 
that works for me, too.
