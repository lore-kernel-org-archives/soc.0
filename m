Hi Tony,

while I agree that it would be great if drivers could just detect when
hardware is not available, this is simply not how most drivers work -
when you instantiate the driver via a non-disabled(/reserved/...) DT
node, the driver expects a usable device.

Especially for busses like I2C, there is no way for a driver to
reliably detect whether the bus is usable or not. (There are several
states that can't really be distinguished: Is pinmuxing missing, or
does the device not need any muxing? Is a line low because it is not
actually connected to anything, or is there another master currently
using the bus, or is the bus stuck due to a faulty device?)

Which is why it is the convention for SoC DTSI files disable nodes for
devices that may be unusable. Taking UARTs as an example, a quick grep
for "serial@" nodes in arch/arm/boot/dts/*.dtsi and
arch/arm64/boot/dts/*/*.dtsi shows that the vast majority of these
nodes is disabled by default.

Regards,
Matthias
