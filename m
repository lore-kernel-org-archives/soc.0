The fact that DDR content isn't maintained across a typical reboot is
certainly causing issues for using pstore.

But afaiu, with pstore we capture various system state into the pstore
and then make that available after reboot. DCC provides a mechanism for
capturing hardware state (by reading register content) and storing that
in DCC-specific SRAM. This can be triggered either by a HW reset, or on
request from the user.

As such it doesn't seem to be a conceptual fit, we perhaps could present
the data as if it was pstore data, but I don't see how the reports
created at runtime would fit into that model.

My take is still that /dev/dcc looks to provide a reasonable ABI, and
the control mechanism was pushed to debugfs for the purpose of enabling
users to play with the interface, and improve it as necessary.
