The majority of users do use boolean in their DT.

Treating these as tri-state doesn't make much sense because what does 
setting the pin to !push-pull mean? Isn't that just open-drain or 
open-source for which also have boolean values? Allowing these to have 
values is unnecessary and enables more invalid combinations.

of_property_read_u32() will return -EOVERFLOW on a boolean value and 
then the default value (0) is used. However, at least for QCom the value 
is ignored.

Looking at max77620, the value is used. However, it is clear that 
push-pull and open-drain operate on the same register bit.

That's fine for now...

I still think it's Tegra that needs fixing. The question is to what 
extent forwards and backwards compatibity is needed on these platforms? 
I'm not sure if we can fix new dtb with old kernel. A new dtb with a 
stable kernel update would be plausible. It may work just replacing 
'drive-push-pull = <0>' cases with 'drive-open-drain'.
