I’ve quickly reviewed the patch; it does implements a custom method BMRQ
rather than a standard or out-of-the-box solution. More details on this is
used based on my understanding below.

I am still evaluating how the BPMP driver is intended to operate on ACPI
systems. In the meantime, I share the same questions noted above. The current
commit message lists several driver features that may not be required for
ACPI, which has introduced some clarity issues regarding the intended design.

For ACPI systems, CPUFreq operates through CPPC via PCC, MEMIO, or
supported backends.

My understanding is that the BMRQ method is called by tegra_bpmp_transfer(),
which supports Tegra-specific drivers for power domains, clocks, resets,
I2C, PCIe, and memory. On ACPI, these can be abstracted through PCC
OpRegions as part of standard methods like _ON/_OFF or other device state
methods. Although device/memory DVFS is trickier since the ACPI
specification lacks standard methods for it today, the commit message
implies these components are largely unused on ACPI systems.

I have raised a query on the thread to clarify this.
