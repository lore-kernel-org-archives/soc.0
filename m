I think you previously said that patch 5 depends on patch 1, so I can't
take 2-6 without also pulling in the memory controller queue.

I can queue as much or as little of 2-6 as you like, but I would like to
avoid pulling in the memory controller queue into the arm smmu tree. But
yes, whichever of those I take, I can put them on a separate branch so
that you're not blocked for the later patches.

You have a better handle on the dependencies, so please tell me what works
for you. I just want to make sure that at least patch 3 lands in my tree,
so we don't get late conflicts with other driver changes.

Will
