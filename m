The check will be broken anyway because binding goes via driver
subsystem and DTS goes via arm-soc.

If both make to the linux-next and next release, then it's not a problem.

Yes, that's preferred. Therefore in DTS patch you say the binding is not
merged and it is here - lore link.

Later as one commit later - yes. Later as other option - not really, why?

There is no separate repo, so we talk about Linux case now.

You should rather make maintainers happy :) and here one asked to split.
