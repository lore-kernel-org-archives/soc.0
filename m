So, fix checkpatch then. It has false positives, because it doesn't know
if the actual error code will sneak outside the kernel or not. But in
the subsystem we internally use ENOTSUPP.

Even better.

You are the developer and owner of the specific hardware, if you have a good
justification for this message _in production_, then leave it, otherwise drop.

Right, but I already thought a step forward, when you drop bitmap APIs,
the bitops are still in place.

If you use proper bitmaps, perhaps this will be easier. You can use one for
each and merge them whenever you want (with bitmap_or() call) or split (with
bitmap_and() respectively):

	bitmap_or(full, raising, failing); // merge
	bitmap_and(raising, full, rasing_mask); // split

...and you should not use that APIs.

Yes. You use __ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS() and .is_visible callback.

I mean you are using a lot of devm(), can mutex be used in IRQ or whatever
that can be triggered after this call?

Thanks for checking! It means that access to client pointer is needed
more often.
