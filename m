Subject: [PATCH 0/3] ARM: dts: Add Lctech Pi F1C200s board support

Hi,

The Lctech Pi F1C200s is a small development board with the eponymous
Allwinner SoC.
It ships with SPI NAND flash, but I couldn't get that to work:
============
spi-nand spi0.0: unknown raw ID 00000000
spi-nand: probe of spi0.0 failed with error -524
============
I leave in the DT node anyway (minus partitions), matching the schematic.

The boards has two USB-C ports, one of which is connected to a USB
serial adapter chip. Since the other one (connected to the MUSB
controller) lacks any CC pin connections, I need to fix the OTG role
here, and went with peripheral. Forcing host mode worked as well, but
requires a separate power supply (although the other USB port works for
that as well).

The board was apparently also sold under the "Cherry Pi" brand before.

Patches 1 and 2 add the required DT bindings for the vendor and board
name strings, patch 3 adds the .dts file.

Please have a look!

Cheers,
Andre
