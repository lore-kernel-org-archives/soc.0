A lot of rules are implied by other rules and this one, how Linus stated
in other thread, might be implied by no-Linuxisms as you want ordering
or stable naming of Linux /dev entries.

I understand your reason is actually different than above, but your code
does not suggest that.

Anyway, if you wanted to have aliases as ABI, it would have to be
documented. You cannot send post-factum DTS and say "we already use it".
Every ABI must be documented before usage.

And this is what my comment was about: "they MUST talk
with upstream open source maintainers before they ship such ABI."

And no, sending such DTS in your v1 is not documenting ABI. Does not count.

Make your case - what is the purpose of it? Boot device? Then you have
"chosen" node for stuff between firmware and OS. There is even a
property called "bootsource". If this is not boot device, but some
calibration data for ONE given instance of IP, regardless whether you
boot from it or not, then I find such case as border-base and not worth
implementing, because basically one can come one month later with "I
need 1000 aliases because my bootloader is patching up every device
node". It's called overlays then...

Best regards,
Krzysztof
