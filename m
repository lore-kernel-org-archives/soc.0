And don't forget the big player(s) such as Microsoft that from time to time
creates an "extension" to the ACPI (in means of additional tables or how some
of the existing data should be interpreted if it's not clear from the ACPI
specification). For instance, above mentioned USB ACPI support for some cases
heavily relies on the MS "extensions". Or earlycon support for ACPI is based
on MS defined SPCR table. And so on...

On top of the above in Linux we also developed some "extensions", for instance
how I²C muxes are described, or how some multi-functional devices are being
enumerated. These specifics we usually document under
Documentation/firmware-guide/acpi/ (see i2c-muxes.rst for the mentioned case).
