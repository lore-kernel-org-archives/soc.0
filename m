OK, please provide examples. I am definitely lost as it doesn't match with
my understanding of how PCC Opregions are/can be used.

Cool, examples please.

Hmm, may be but I need examples.

Good, then just keep what it needs in the implementation nothing more
until you add support for something you have described below(not that
I agree, just want you to make progress here based on what is actually
required today)

Then let us discuss that in the future, don't add unnecessary complexity
for some future use case today. You can always add it when you introduce
that feature or support in the future.

Let us keep it simple(KISS). The driver works just for PCC not PCC Opregion
for now.

NACK again just to re-iterate my point if you have not yet accepted that
fact.

The example you had IIRC is use of System Memory Opregion to demonstrate
some _DSM. That has nothing to do with PCC Opregion.

Commit 77e2a04745ff ("ACPI: PCC: Implement OperationRegion handler for
the PCC Type 3 subtype") has the example in the commit message. IIRC,
you have even fixed couple of bugs in that driver. That is the reason
why I don't understand how you think this driver and that can or must
work together. At least I fail to see how ATM(examples please, by that
I mean ASL snippet for PCC vs PCC Opregion usage to work with this driver)
