Right, I think in both cases, there is no top-level subsystem
maintainer, but the rules are specific to the second-level
hierarchy: most parts of drivers/platform/ happen to go
through the x86 platform maintainer trees, and for drivers/soc
we merge most stuff through the soc tree, but a few parts
of each have different maintainers.

I would prefer the soc tree, and will just apply the
patches from Yinbo Zhu directly this time as I already
have them in my queue. If there are more than a few
drivers/soc/loongarch/ patches in the future, maybe you can
pick them up into a separate branch and forward those
to soc@kernel.org.

Note that I have two separate roles here: I have the
asm-generic tree that I maintain for patches to
include/asm-generic as well as the occasional new
architecture review as I did for loongarch.

The other one is the group maintained soc tree that
is mainly for Arm device tree files, but also contains
soc specific code (arch/arm/mach-*), defconfig files,
drivers (drivers/{soc,firmware,memory,reset}). This is
now extended to arch/riscv and occasionally other
architectures as well, so drivers/soc/loongson fits
well in here.
