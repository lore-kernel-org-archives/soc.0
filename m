To get everyone on the same page: in a nutshell, BPMP is a separate
processor that handles various aspects of power management (Boot and
Power Management Processor). The CPU communicates with it over a shared
memory region and a mailbox/doorbell for signalling.

My understanding is that an ACPI systems, as opposed to DT where we do
this all through kernel drivers, the inter-processor communication is
done via AML. This is because standard power management operations use
this same mechanism to enable clocks, deassert resets, etc.

I think this goes back to the disconnect from the patch thread and
earlier in this discussion: the intent was very much to encapsulate all
the power management within standard ACPI methods, and that's working
fine, hence why clocks, resets and power domains are not getting exposed
on ACPI systems.

However, there's no equivalent in ACPI to expose these MBWT knobs, hence
the need to expose this through BPMP directly.
