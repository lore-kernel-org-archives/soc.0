We understand that ;-)
What Jernej meant was that the DTS patches at the end depend on patch
01/10, which adds to the PHY binding doc. I am not sure if Vinod's
suggestion was about splitting off 01/10, 03/10, and 10/10, or just the
two latter which touch the driver.

I can split off 03/10 and 10/10, rebased on top of linux-phy.git/next, and
send that to Vinod.
Then I would keep 01/10 in a respin of this series here, to satisfy the
dependency of the later DTS patches, and Vinod can pick that one patch from
there?

Cheers,
Andre
